# AddressBook-C
A console-based contact management application that allows users to easily store, search, edit, and delete personal or professional contacts through a simple command-line interface. It supports searching by Name, Mobile Number, or Email with case-insensitive matching and saves data persistently using CSV file handling.

The project is modular, using separate .c and .h files, and employs structures and arrays for efficient data storage. Input validation ensures reliable entries, and the text-based interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
